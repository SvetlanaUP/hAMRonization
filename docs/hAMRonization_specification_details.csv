It is typically derived from the gene/gene product name.,String,"catA1, blaOXA-101","Acceptable values may represent gene symbols or gene product symbols. ""Gene symbol"" and ""allele"" (based on amino acid variations) may be used interchangeably due to nuances in resistance gene family nomenclature. Parsers should include values from ""gene symbol"" and ""allele"" fields in this category. Either the ""gene symbol"" or the ""gene name"" must be provided.","every aa diff for beta lactamases is a new allele, not the case for all amr gene families; novel allele, leave it blank","Comment: I don't think if it's a novel allele, this should be blank (hence why it's mandatory); it should instead say 'blaOXA', just without a number afterwards designating a specific allele (or it will alternatively list the allele with closest homology)"
Gene Name,Mandatory,"The name of a gene, (typically) assigned by a person and/or according to a naming scheme. It may contain white space characters and is typically more intuitive and readable than a gene symbol. It (typically) may be used to identify similar genes in different species and to derive a gene symbol.",String,type A-1 chloramphenicol O-acetyltransferase ,"The long name for the gene/protein. Gene names or gene product names are acceptable.  Either the ""gene symbol"" or the ""gene name"" must be provided.",stress long form (describes protein); gene name or protein name?,
Coverage (depth),Optional,Coverage (read depth or depth) is the average number of reads representing a given nucleotide in the reconstructed sequence.,Float,56,The value is expressed as a fold value e.g. 56x.,,
Coverage (%),Optional,The percentage of the reference sequence covered by the sequence of interest.,Float,90,"The sequences can refer to reads and genome, nucelotides and genes, or amino acids and proteins. This value should be normalized and expressed as percentage. Do not include the ""%"" sign in the value. Either ""% Coverage (breadth)"" of ""Coverage (breadth) is required.","Comment: I think this should be mandatory; if you have a hit for a gene, the first question you have is the % identity and % length. This is necessary context to determine whether it's likely a functional protein.",
Coverage (ratio),Optional,The ratio of the reference sequence covered by the sequence of interest.,,450/500,"The sequences can refer to reads and genome, nucelotides and genes, or amino acids and proteins. This value should not be normalized and expressed as the ratio of actual positions being compared e.g. 450/500. Either ""% Coverage (breadth)"" of ""Coverage (breadth) is required.",,
Sequence Identity,Mandatory,Sequence identity is the number (%) of matches (identical characters) in positions from an alignment of two molecular sequences.,Float,1,"The sequences can refer to reads and genome, nucelotides and genes, or amino acids and proteins.

The user may have to provide the value. Semantic versioning is strongly recommended.,https://semver.org/,"Comment: the version of the gene database is more typical than the software, so this should perhaps not be required"
